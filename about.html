            These must in the final analysis be solved by Africans themselves

            This World Health Organization (WHO) quotation brings into
            perspectives the challenge that confronts us as Intellectuals,
            Scientists and Policy makers to solve our problems with resources
            from our own back yards i.e. medicinal plants and other natural
            products within the environment. There is no doubt that medicinal
            and aromatic plants have great potentiality in the amelioration of
            suffering in human and other living beings.

            Realising that there is no scientific evidence for believing that
            orthodox medicine is the only effective way of dealing with our
            health problems; the Ethno and Natural Health College was registered
            in 2009 for the training of ethno and natural medicine practitioners
            and has been providing such services to identify common medicinal
            plants and learn to formulate herbal remedies to support health,
            address specific health challenges, and enhance the optimal function
            of the body.
